This project is going to create a basic recipes website using all of the beginner html stuff I've learned lol

This includes the basic ! command to create the initial html board, as well as using <ul> for unorganized lists, 
<ol> for orgnaized lists, <a> to apply attriutes such as <a href=""> for links, <img src=""> for images, 
<strong> for boldface, <em> for italics, and so on.
